CS alumni soon to be..
my life is moving asynchronously:).I need someone to handle me like .then handles the promise:(.I will make sure to handle using .catch().
No read.md anymore I am taking break for real. Who cares though. Learning tailwind so that I could make my life more easier  to style because CSS could not.
